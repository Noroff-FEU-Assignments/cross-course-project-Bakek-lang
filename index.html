    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would advise my potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks by adopting a cybersecurity framework to develop a well organized approach to security. The company should plan for a worst-case scenario, including a response plan and backup of data. Security is not just for those who are specialized in it, it may involve everyone in the business. Therefore, secure software development practices are necessary, including educating developers about potential security problems and scanning for vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development lifecycle. Different security measurements should be used, including, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and network scanning. All user-data should be sanitized before it is displayed, also a web application cannot trust any data from the web browser. Your web server should be configured to use HTTPS and HSTS, HTTPS encrypts data sent between your client and server, this will make data less available for a potential attacker. Only store and display data from a user that you really need, for example when a user has credit card information. It is a widely used practice that only the 4 last numbers are being shown so that the user can recognize the card, without attackers being able to copy it for harmful use.
